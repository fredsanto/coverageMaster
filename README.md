# coverageMaster CNV Caller

coverageMaster is a CNV calling algorithm based on depth-of-coverage maps to detect CNVs of size>50pb at nucleotide level in Whole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing data. coverageMaster analyzes the sequencing coverage in a multidimensional Wavelet compressed (nucleotide-like) space and the CNVs are inferred with Hidden Markov Models (HMM).
